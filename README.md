### Python

You need Python 3.5 or later to run mypy. You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

For other Linux flavors, macOS and Windows, packages are available at

https://www.python.org/getit/

### Spacy

We need spaCy for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python.

```python
$ pip install spacy
# $ conda install -y spacy
```

```python
$ spacy.__version__
```

    '2.0.12'

### NumPy

Need `NumPy` to work with arrays.

```python
$ pip install numpy
# $ conda install numpy
```

### Pandas

Need `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.

```python
$ pip install pandas
# $ conda install pandas
```

### SciKit Learn

We used `scikit-learn` for performance evaluations.

```python
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
# $ conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
```
